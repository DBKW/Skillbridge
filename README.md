### About Me

In the mid-to-late 1990's I was all in. In addition to collecting every hacker book I could get my hands on, I built my own website called "Give Aliens Your Corn." Fast forward a few years and my first computer science class in undergrad left me disgruntled. This stuff wasn't for me. The next 20 years I would serve in the US Army. First as an intelligence officer and then later as a military strategist. I finished my career at Naval Postgraduate School where I taught emerging technology. strategy, and policy -- which led me to agile planning and ultimately down the rabbithole of web3. 

Today I am transitioning out of the US Army through the skillbridge program via CS Engineering. I am learning to code in 'solidity' so i can start building in web3 and this repository will be my record of my skillbridge journey! A 20 year story arc in coding!

[HippoCanon](https://www.hippocanon.com) is a decentralized storytelling platform connecting storytellers, collaborators, and readers together via a collaborative publishing process and a novel story discovery engine that immerses readers into the variety of perspectives that make up every event and story. As a start, HippoCanon is focusing on collecting stories from [post-9/11 veterans](https://hippocanon.com/veterans-initiative). We are currently building our initial set of beta testers who will help validate our processes and assumptions. In November 2023, we will fully launch our veteran story effort, with the aim of building the largest database of stories from the last 20 years of persistent conflict and war.
